# lab5

This lab was interesting  as I haven’t worked with the sdl2 library before. It was really hard at first when you didn’t understand 
how the sdl2 classes and methods worked but after a couple of hours reading I understood the basics and it made it significantly easier
to code. 

The most difficult thing for me in this lab was to understand how to render shapes on the screen without creating a new window. 
As I at first basically copied the tutorial ( the  one you provided)  window source code to each shape it opened a new window every time
I changed shapes.  I solved this by reading on  the sdl2 wiki on what each function did in the creation of the window, with that 
I could deduct what methods were used for the creation of the window and what rendered the shapes.

I would say this was a good designed lab although I found some of the task explanations a  bit lacking, for example the ‘render()’ 
method in the shape class, was difficult to understand. I was a unsure of what it was supposed to do. as it was a virtual function I
just assumed that it was supposed to be empty so that we could understand the concepts of virtual functions. 

I spent roughly 14 hours on this lab.
